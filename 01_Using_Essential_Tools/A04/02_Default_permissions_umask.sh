touch file_perms

ls -l file_perms 

chmod -v 666 file_perms # or

chmod -v o+w file_perms






The command chmod, change mode, is used to adjust the file permissions. Using
the option -v we are able to display both the current and newly assigned
permissions. We can use either binary or symbolic notation.
